# HackYourFuture Web Architecture 101

## ✅ Our todo.com app

During class, we designed a Tasks app together [(diagrams here)](https://excalidraw.com/#json=iaQN0zV5TRivr6DS_3v3q,VELqsSWw4ZvecL0Uzj6l_A) with a small frontend and backend.

We were going to do a little bit of coding, but our TV ☠️ died during the session ☠️.

:octocat: This Github Repository contains the code from the session:

- The server code is `server.js`
- The client app (web page) is in the `/client` directory.

### ⚠️ Important ⚠️

Remember that this is using advanced javascript concepts we haven't explored yet.

I tried my best to:
- to keep it as simple as possible
- to add a lot of comments that explain what things are

However, some of these things will only make sense later in the hackyourfuture program.

🦄 This means, some things will feel magical, but feel free to explore the code or use your browser's Network panel to see what is happening with the HTTP requests and responses 🔎

‼️ Note: This is **NOT a part** of your assignments, so just sharing it for your curiosity, (and because I promised ✨)

## 🎯 Instructions - How to set up this small app

#### In your terminal, run these commands (you only need to do this once):

```sh
# Step 1. Clone this repository from Github
git clone https://github.com/jesusoterogomez/tasks-app-demo

# Step 2. Change into the new directory
cd tasks-app-demo

# Step 3. Install the software that we need to run this server
npm install
```

### To run the app

Run this in your terminal while in the `tasks-app-demo` directory

```sh
# Step 4. Starts the server in the URL http://127.0.0.1:4000
npm start
```

### ✅ That's it

You can view the application by going to the URL: http://127.0.0.1:4000 in your Web Browser, when the server is running.

To close the server, press this key combination on your terminal:
- 🪟 In Windows: Control + C
- 🍎 In Mac: Command + C
