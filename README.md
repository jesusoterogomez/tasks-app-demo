# ✅ HackYourFuture Web Architecture 101 - Our todo.com app

During class, we designed a Tasks app together with a small frontend and backend.

Here are the diagrams we made: https://excalidraw.com/#json=iaQN0zV5TRivr6DS_3v3q,VELqsSWw4ZvecL0Uzj6l_A

We were going to do a little bit of coding, but our TV died during the session ☠️.

This Github Repository contains the code from the session.

- The server code is `server.js`
- The client app (web page) is in the `/client` directory.

### ⚠️ Disclaimer

Remember that this is using advanced javascript concepts we haven't explored yet.

I did my best to keep it as simple as possible and to add comments that explain what things are, but some of these things will make sense later in the hackyourfuture program.

‼️ Note: This is _not a part_ of the assignments, so just sharing it for your curiosity, and because I promised :)

### How to set up this small app

#### In your terminal, run these commands (you only need to do this once):

```sh
# Step 1. Clone this repository from Github
git clone https://github.com/jesusoterogomez/task-app-demo

# Step 2. Change into the new directory
cd tasks-app-demo

# Step 3. Install the necessary software that we need to run this server
npm install
```

### To run the app

Run this in your terminal while in the `task-app-demo` directory :)

```sh
# Step 4. Starts the server in the URL http://127.0.0.1:4000
npm start
```

### ✅ That's it

You're free to try it out, and explore the code.
