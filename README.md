# HackYourFuture Web Architecture 101

## ✅ Our todo.com app

During class, we designed a Tasks app together with a small frontend and backend.

We were going to do a little bit of coding, but our TV ☠️ died during the session ☠️.

Here are the diagrams we made: https://excalidraw.com/#json=iaQN0zV5TRivr6DS_3v3q,VELqsSWw4ZvecL0Uzj6l_A

This Github Repository contains the code from the session:

- The server code is `server.js`
- The client app (web page) is in the `/client` directory.

### ⚠️ Disclaimer

Remember that this is using advanced javascript concepts we haven't explored yet.

I did my best to keep it as simple as possible and to add a lot of comments that explain what things are, but some of these things will only make sense later in the hackyourfuture program.

This means, some things will feel magical, but feel free to explore the code or use your browsers Network panel to explore what is happening 🔎

‼️ Note: This is _not a part_ of the assignments, so just sharing it for your curiosity, and because I promised :)

### How to set up this small app

#### In your terminal, run these commands (you only need to do this once):

```sh
# Step 1. Clone this repository from Github
git clone https://github.com/jesusoterogomez/tasks-app-demo

# Step 2. Change into the new directory
cd tasks-app-demo

# Step 3. Install the software that we need to run this server
npm install
```

### To run the app

Run this in your terminal while in the `tasks-app-demo` directory

```sh
# Step 4. Starts the server in the URL http://127.0.0.1:4000
npm start
```

### ✅ That's it

You can view the application by going to the URL: http://127.0.0.1:4000 in your Web Browser, when the server is running.

To close the server, press this key combination on your terminal:
- 🪟 In Windows: Control + C
- 🍎 In Mac: Command + C
